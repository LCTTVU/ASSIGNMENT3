        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This website will give a thorough evaluation of the website we created for Webtech assignments, using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> and feedback from Teaching Assistants.</p>
        <p>Appendix A will assess the accessibility of the page according to the WCAG's success levels (A, AA, AAA), using provided requirements. For each guideline, a short discussion and conclusion will be included for clarification or making comparisons where relevant.</p>
        <p>Appendix B will compile and categorize TA feedback. </p>
        <p>Overall, our website comes close to meeting Accessibility Level A. The website meets many of the more important requirements listed by the WCAG, and the impact of unfulfilled requirements is not high due to the limited amount of content (text, links, images, etc.) on our page.</p>
        <p>With some improvements, which will be discussed in the Improvement Plan section, the website can reach success level A.</p>
